# Assemble

**Quick Start:**

* `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* `npm install`
* `grunt serve` to assemble, run through all themes
* `grunt global` to assemble, run through all global files only
* `grunt specific` to assemble, run through all specific files only

**TODO**

* Write proper style guides and design patterns
* Break down grunt tasks into more faster respective builds (clean etc)
* Test API calls
