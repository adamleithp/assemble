# Assemble

**Quick Start:**

* `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* `npm install`
* `grunt dev` dev environment
* `grunt prod` dev environment, but produces production ready static files with compression of all media.

**TODO**

* Documentation: Write proper style guides and design patterns
* Grunt: Break down grunt tasks into more faster respective builds (clean etc)
* Development: Test API calls from forms

**Assemble static site generator**

You can use this to build a highly functional static website. Building your static / flat html website with minimal effort. Master at handlebars? Go ahead, tear this apart.

Per page javascript files, per page css files, compiled and rendered in the folder structure you set.

**Goals of this project**

The goal is to achieve a highly customizable static website generator build on assemble and handlebars.

I want to utilize the includes and helpers as a ~pseudo~ components.
