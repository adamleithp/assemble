# Assemble

**Quick Start:**

* `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* `npm install`
* `grunt serve` to assemble, run through all themes
* `grunt global` to assemble, run through all global files only
* `grunt specific` to assemble, run through all specific files only

**TODO**

* Documentation: Write proper style guides and design patterns
* Grunt: Break down grunt tasks into more faster respective builds (clean etc)
* Grunt: Allow specific theme to be compiled, from `grunt serve --theme=base` or `grunt serve --theme=moveVar1` etc.
* Development: Test API calls
